<p>This is a political-military strategy game. The player's team is composed of soldiers from four cliques. Players need to balance the forces of each clique and continue to grow the team to defeat more powerful enemies. The player arranges the starting lineup, then the soldiers fight automatically. Players can use three skills, namely reinforcement, bombing, and inducing an enemy soldier to surrender. </p>

<p>[Player Decision]</p>


<p>Each player's team has two attributes, which are starting lineup limit and skill points, which can be upgraded and distributed through the accumulation of experience in battle.</p>


<p>Players can recruit soldiers in the lobby scene, or recruit enemy soldiers in the battle scene.</p>


<p>Players can choose enemies and arrange the starting lineup for the next battle.</p>


<p>The reinforcement skill consumes 1 skill point, and each time you can reinforce one soldier.</p>


<p>The bombing skill consumes 2 skill points. Click the skill button and the specified cell in turn to take effect. The soldiers corresponding to the cell and its adjacent cells will take damage, and the soldiers corresponding to the cell will take double the damage.</p>


<p>The inducing an enemy soldier to surrender skill consumes 3 skill points and can recruit enemy soldiers whose prestige value is orange-red.</p>


<p>[Soldier]</p>


<p>Each soldier has three attributes, which are clique, defense level, and prestige.</p>


<p>The defense level is represented by stars, which are divided into 1~4 stars, and 4 stars soldiers have the strongest defense.</p>


<p>The four cliques are Worker, Crown, Antler, and Eagle.</p>


<p>Soldiers with a defense of one or two stars and prestige of at most 20 may be recruited, and their prestige is marked in orange-red fonts.</p>


<p>[Prestige]</p>


<p>The prestige of a soldier is affected by the outcome of the battle and the change of the team leader.</p>


<p>A soldier with a low prestige may be recruited by the opponent, and a soldier with prestige of 0 will leave the team after the battle.</p>


<p>The soldier with the highest prestige in the team will become the leader, and his clique will determine the flag of the team. Four different cliques have different attribute bonuses.</p>


<p>The Worker clique increases the upper limit of the starting lineup by 2 points.</p>


<p>The Crown clique can recruit soldiers whose prestige is less than 40.</p>


<p>The Antler clique has a 50% star rate bonus for recruiting soldiers.</p>


<p>The Eagle clique adds 2 skill points, up to a maximum of 15.</p>
